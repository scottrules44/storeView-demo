StoreView Plugin For Corona

The Store view Plugin presents a store that allows the user to purchase other media from the App Store. 

For example, your app might display the store to allow the user to purchase another app. This is done via a popup, so your users do not have to leave your app.

Being able to show users your other apps instantly via a popup increases the chance of getting a purchase of your other apps, along with increasing the probability of a rating.
